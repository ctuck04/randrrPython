This console app is a cross between a tennis game and a tennis game score recorder. After the user enters 
the names of the players, the user is prompted to record which player--Player 1 or Player 2--has scored by typing
either the '1' key or the '2' key. The user is notified when a game is won, when a set is won, and, 
ultimately, when the match is won. The user can quit at any time by pressing the '4' key. In order to 
run the console app, I wrote it in TextWrangler on my MacBook Pro and clicked the '!#' button on the 
top navigation bar of TextWrangler.
